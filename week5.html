                        Another week that ushered in new modules for the course.
                        First was <b><mark> Introduction to Financial and Cost Accounting </mark> </b>.
                        Getting to know the diffrence between <i>finance</i> and <i>accounting</i> was humbling.
                        Finance deal with actual cashflow and accounting mainly profit and loss.
                        We went through major types of business;
                        <ul>
                            <li>Manufacturing</li>
                            <li>Merchandise</li>
                            <li>Service</li>
                        </ul>
                        Later through major business organisations;
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sole proprietorship</li>
                            <li>Partnership</li>
                            <li>Corporation</li>
                        </ul>
                        Another talking point was <b>liability</b> is a <b>debt</b>.
                        Also having a <i>Business strategy</i> which has plans and actions to gain an upperhand
                        over competitors. It can be a low cost or a differential one.
                        Knowing your value chain enables you to know where to add value to the product to benefit 
                        the customer.
                        This led us to <i><b>Business stakeholders</b></i> who have an interest in the economic
                        performance of the business. They are either internal or external. Once identified, we can
                        assess their information needs, design a system, record economic data and then prepare 
                        accounting statements.
                        To do Business one needs ethics:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Avoid small ethical lapses.</li>
                                <li>Focus on long term reputation. </li>
                                <li>Having ethics leads to personal consequences one has to endure. </li>
                            </ul>
                        There are also <b>Generally Accepted Accounting Principle</b> (GAAP) based on:
                        <ul>
                            <li> Business entity concept </li>
                            <li> Cost concept </li>
                            <li> Objectivity concept </li>
                            <li> Unit of measure concept </li>
                        </ul>
                        This culminated to the accounting equation,
                        <b> <mark> Assets = liabilities + owner’s equity </mark> </b>.
                        <img src="images/alc.PNG" > <br>
                        Assets are,
                            <ul>
                                <li> Longterm /fixed </li>
                                <li> Short term / current </li>
                            </ul>
                            Liabilities
                            <ul>    
                                <li> Current/short term </li>
                                <li> Long term/ fixed </li>
                            </ul>
                            Owner’s equity,
                            which is increased by,
                            <ul>
                                <li> Revenue </li>
                                <li> Investment </ul>
                            </ul>
                            and decreased by,
                            <ul>
                                <li> Expenses </li>
                                <li> dividends </li>
                            </ul>
                        Finally the major financial reports known as <i>finavial statements</i>
                        <ul>
                                <li> cashflow </li>
                                <li> Income/Profit or loss </li>
                                <li> Owner’s Equity</li>
                                <li>Balance sheet</li>
                        </ul>
                      </p>
