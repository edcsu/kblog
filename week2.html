                          Tuesday was Worker's day which is a public holiday that we respected 
                          and we rested.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        I gave a snippet on the fourth habit mentioned in the book <mark><i>The 7 
                          Habits Of Highly Effective People</i></mark> written by <b>Stephen R. Covey</b>
                           which is <em>"Think Win-Win"</em>. It's a princple of interpaersonal leadership
                        For it to work the following have to be achieved:-
                            <ol>
                                <li>My character has to be built on integrity, maturity and abundant mentality.</li>
                                <li>Have relationships based on trust and positive cooperative energy.</li>
                                <li>The relationships should be based on agreements that are defined and directly
                                    lead to win-win.</li>
                                <li>Engage in win-win trainings.</li>
                                <li>Then perform win-win tasks.</li>
                            </ol>
                            
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        We talked about presenting feedback using the <em> <mark> Sandwich method. </mark> </em>
                        First I praise the recepient, then give constructive critiscism and finally give them a target
                        to undertake.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Also I got to know 16 negotiating do's that I must undergo before I get to the negotiation table
                        as per <b> Dr. Tim Henning. </b>
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        We were introduced to <mark>JavaScript</mark> fundamentals later getting
                        into <mark>Git</mark> and <mark> Github</mark> which I will forever use
                        to reduce on the clatter of files at saved instances in a future project
                        like this blog.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Finally on Friday, we had another practical session on web development.
                        Working on bootstrap and getting an assignment which I duly completed
                        over the weekend.
                      </p>
