                        It began on Monday 26<sup>th</sup>. First up was the leadership course which stretched all
                        my imaginations. It was an eye opener to the way I view leadership that it's enshrined in all
                        of us and being a leadership position doesn't mean it's leadership.
                        Later we drew out a career development plan personally that we are going to follow through
                        in the course and later on i.e <em> long term goals </em>.
                        Later on in the day, we were introduced to software development platforms and <mark> HTML5 </mark>
                          not forgetting <i><mark>CSS</mark></i>. I got exposed to Microsoft <em>Visual Code Studio</em>
                        that simplified my coding experience and local hosting with <em>XAMP</em> just enlighted me further
                        in web development.

                        Mid-week we talked about change and how we react to it. The four polar axes;
                        <ul>
                          <li>Incremental</li>
                          <li>Radical</li>
                          <li>Focused</li>
                          <li>Flexible</li>
                        </ul>
                        help us to find out how we react to problems. I doing so, we have to take up these roles;
                        <ul>
                            <li>Visionary</li>
                            <li>Strategist</li>
                            <li>Planner</li>
                            <li>Practioner</li>
                          </ul>
                          to become effective leaders.
                      </p> 

                      <p>
                        Can't wait for next week.
