                        It was one that I couldn't help waiting for as it was another stepping stone in my career.
                        Emails had been rolled out to each cohort participant a week before.
                        Anticipation and alertness crippled into my body as each day passed that week.
                        Before I knew it was Thursday 19<sup>th</sup> 2018. Dday!
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Prior to that, we received emails confirming that we ware part of the <mark><strong><em>
                        Microsoft App Factory Hub Africa</em></strong> </mark> another plus that got me thinking
                         that this was worth it.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I reached the university (Clark International University) in time for the presentations.
                        One by one my fellow cohorts flocked in. Smartly clad in their attires you would mistake it
                         for an interview session.
                        We were ushered in by Martins and Joan. All our faces were screaming 
                        <strong><em>This is it!</em></strong>
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        One by one we introduced ourselves to the room which was by now filled to the brim. This helped
                        know a little more of my colleagues. Next it was the programme facilitators. They too gave us a 
                        brief background about themselves and snippets of what they contributed on the program. This made
                        things a bit clearer of what I had delved in. Their approach to this program made my inquistive
                        self intrigued further and feel this isn't the usual drill of learning.
                        Finally the session was capped off by the reassuring and calm words of the vice chancellor which
                        made me feel at home.

                      <p>
                          Time flew past by fast and the session that had began mid-morning had edged into the afternoon.
                          I was awash with optmism and I coudn't wait for Monday to get it started.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Can't wait for next week.
